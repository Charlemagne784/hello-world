I am beginning a new chapter combining web development with financial operations, marketing and sales. I am fully licensed with FINRA to present, explain and sell securities to the public. I really like the problem solving part of this type of work as it makes me think logically and persevere when things are challenging.  
I am trying to figure out the best, fastest and least expensive way to obtain formalized full stack training and how to get a job in this industry.
